#SparkJNI default properties file: Change properties if needed.
#NATIVE_SOURCE_PATH is the path to your desired source directory (i.e. where SparkJNI also generates wrappers and the template kernel.
#BUILD_MODE has 4 possible options: FULL_GENERATE_AND_BUILD, JAVAH_MAKEFILE_AND_BUILD, JUST_BUILD, ASSUME_EVERYTHING_IS_THERE.
#OVERWRITE_KERNEL set to false stops SparkJNI in overwriting the kernel, if it exists and conforms to the default name.
#The application name (and the derivatives e.g. kernel file name) are set with APP_NAME. DEFAULT ignores this field and uses the Maven project as a resource for the project name.
